			# NOTE: near() method has problems with includes or left outer joins.  
			# To use near() with left outer joins, do query conditions without includes BEFORE ARel compiles and executes:

			max_distance = 1000 # in km
			@venues = @venues.near([params[:latitude], params[:longitude]], max_distance) # outer join comes after this line

		# For more info about activerecord relations (difference between find vs. where method), see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9574659/rails-where-vs-find
		# IMPORTANT: Make sure geocoder near() method is before the left outer join statement
